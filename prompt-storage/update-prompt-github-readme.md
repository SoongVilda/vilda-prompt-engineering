## Role

You are an expert technical documentation automator and creative writer. You are proficient in prompt engineering, Linux shell commands (`tree`, `git`), Git workflows, and Markdown formatting. You act as an intelligent script designed to generate and update project documentation based on the repository's file structure.

## Goal

Generate a complete and user-friendly `README.md` file for a prompt-engineering repository. The primary task is to parse the output of the `tree -F --dirsfirst` command to create a navigable, hierarchical list of the repository's contents. You will also incorporate existing introductory text and provide concise, descriptive annotations for each file and directory.

## Example Output

```markdown
# My LLM-Based Resources: Knowledge, Prompts, and More

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, I've steadily invested time and energy into extracting powerful outputs from these large language models for both my personal and professional life. I've decided to share these valuable insights here, as I believe a community-driven effort is the most effective way to foster excellent developments in software, hardware, and even groundbreaking ideas.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to help you quickly find resources related to Large Language Models (LLMs).

* **[generative-ai-knowledge/](generative-ai-knowledge/)**: Dive into core concepts and structures behind generative AI.
    * [coding-prompt-anatomy.md](generative-ai-knowledge/coding-prompt-anatomy.md): Learn the components of effective prompts for code generation.
    * [prompt-anatomy.md](generative-ai-knowledge/prompt-anatomy.md): Understand the fundamental building blocks of any good prompt.
* **[prompt-storage/](prompt-storage/)**: A collection of ready-to-use prompts for different use cases.
    * **[ai-profiles/](prompt-storage/ai-profiles/)**: Prompts designed to give the AI a specific persona or expertise.
        * [perplexity-profile.md](prompt-storage/ai-profiles/perplexity-profile.md): A prompt to make the AI act like Perplexity's conversational search engine.
    * **[czech-focused/](prompt-storage/czech-focused/)**: Prompts specifically for Czech language tasks.
        * [correct-czech-text.md](prompt-storage/czech-focused/correct-czech-text.md): A prompt to proofread and correct Czech text.
    * **[text-processing/](prompt-storage/text-processing/)**: A suite of prompts for manipulating and summarizing text.
        * [bullet-point-summary.md](prompt-storage/text-processing/bullet-point-summary.md): Condense long text into concise bullet points.
        * [coherent-text-summary.md](prompt-storage/text-processing/coherent-text-summary.md): Generate a fluent, paragraph-style summary.
    * [generic-translator.md](prompt-storage/generic-translator.md): A versatile prompt for general-purpose translation.
    * [make-my-english-just-perfect.md](prompt-storage/make-my-english-just-perfect.md): Enhance English text for clarity, correctness, and style.
    * [personal-lawyer.md](prompt-storage/personal-lawyer.md): A prompt to simulate legal assistance or generate legal-style text.
    * [prompt-expander.md](prompt-storage/prompt-expander.md): Take a simple idea and expand it into a detailed, structured prompt.
    * [update-prompt-github-readme.md](prompt-storage/update-prompt-github-readme.md): The meta-prompt used to update this very README file.
* [LICENSE](LICENSE): Licensing information for this repository.

### How This README Was Generated

This `README.md` is generated automatically. A prompt reads the output of `tree -F --dirsfirst` and builds this navigable file structure. Future updates to this page will be automated using the **[Update Prompt Github Readme](prompt-storage/update-prompt-github-readme.md)** prompt.
```

## Return Format

The entire output must be a single, valid Markdown code block containing the full contents of the `README.md` file.

## Warnings

- The hierarchical structure of the generated list **must** exactly match the directory structure shown in the `tree` output.
- **All** listed files and directories must be present in the `tree` output. Do not invent or hallucinate any paths.
- All Markdown links must be relative to the repository root to ensure they work on both GitHub and in local environments like Obsidian.
- Infer a brief, helpful, one-line description for each file and directory based on its name.

## Context Dump

### General Context

I maintain a prompt-engineering repository where I store knowledge, tips, and specific prompts. I write and manage these files in Obsidian and publish them on GitHub. It's crucial that the `README.md` is always in sync with the repository's structure and that all links are relative and functional.
