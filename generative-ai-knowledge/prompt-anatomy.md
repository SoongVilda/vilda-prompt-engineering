## Explanation

This minimalistic template is powerful because it systematically combines several key prompt engineering techniques in a logical flow. This guide explains each component, the academic technique it leverages, and the source paper that validates its effectiveness.

### Role
- **Technique:** **Role Prompting**
- This section leverages Role Prompting to define the function or expert profile the AI should adopt. It's a high-impact, low-effort way to control the tone, vocabulary, and perspective of the response. A well-defined role (e.g., *Senior Software Engineer*, *Cynical Marketing Expert*, *Helpful Librarian*) tells the AI *who* it should be for the task.

> - **Link:** [A Survey of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223)
> - **Relevance:** This academic survey places "role-play" prompting within the broader context of adapting LLMs for specific scenarios, confirming its effectiveness as a recognized method.

### Goal
- **Technique:** **Clear Instruction**
- This section defines the primary objective of your prompt. This is the foundation of all effective prompting, ensuring the model's powerful capabilities are aimed squarely at your intended target. A well-defined goal ensures the AI understands its mission and prevents it from making incorrect assumptions.

> - **Source:** "Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners (FLAN)" by Jason Wei et al. (2021)
> - **Link:** [Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01652)
> - **Relevance:** This paper proves that training models on a wide variety of clear instructions makes them dramatically better at new tasks, establishing the foundational importance of explicit goals.

### Example
- **Technique:** **Few-Shot Prompting** (or One-Shot, for a single example)
- This powerful technique involves showing, not just telling. By providing a concrete, imitable sample of the desired output, you allow the model to learn the required format and style by inference. For any structured data, this is often faster and more precise than describing it abstractly.

> - **Source:** "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" by Tom B. Brown et al. (2020)
> - **Link:** [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
> - **Relevance:** This is the seminal GPT-3 paper that introduced "in-context learning," showing that models can learn to perform a task from just a few examples in the prompt without any retraining.

### Return Format
- **Technique:** **Output Formatting**
- This section gives you explicit control over the output's final structure, which is critical for making it predictable and usable. Use this when an example isn't provided or to add further constraints. It ensures the response integrates seamlessly into your workflow.

> - **Source:** This is a direct application of the principles in "Finetuned Language Models Are Zero-Shot Learners (FLAN)".
> - **Relevance:** The ability of a model to adhere to a specific format is a measure of its instruction-following capability. The FLAN paper demonstrates how models are trained to become better at following all kinds of instructions, including complex formatting rules.

### Warnings
- **Technique:** **Constraint Prompting**
- This technique acts as a guardrail. By outlining limitations or actions the AI must avoid (e.g., "do not exceed 300 words," "avoid technical jargon"), you refine the output and prevent undesirable results, ensuring the response adheres to your specific guidelines.

> - **Source:** "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback" by Yuntao Bai et al. (2022)
> - **Link:** [Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)
> - **Relevance:** This paper pioneers the use of explicit principles and constraints (a "constitution") to guide AI behavior, demonstrating the power of telling a model what *not* to do.

### Context Dump
- **Technique:** **Contextual Prompting** (The foundation for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG**)
- This is where you provide all necessary background information. This "grounds" the model in the specific data you provide, forcing it to generate answers based on that context rather than its general pre-trained knowledge. This drastically improves factual accuracy and is a cornerstone of advanced, reliable AI systems.

> - **Source:** "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks (RAG)" by Patrick Lewis et al. (2020)
> - **Link** [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)
> - **Relevance:** This is the foundational paper that introduced the RAG framework, proving that grounding a model's generation with retrieved, factual context drastically improves accuracy and reliability.
