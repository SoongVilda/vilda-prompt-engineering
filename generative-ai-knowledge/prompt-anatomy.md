## Explanation

### Role

This section defines the **function or expert profile** the AI should adopt. It's a high-impact, low-effort way to control the tone, vocabulary, and perspective of the response. A well-defined role (e.g., _Senior Software Engineer_, _Cynical Marketing Expert_, _Helpful Librarian_) tells the AI _who_ it should be for the task.

### Goal

This section is where you define the **primary objective** of your prompt. What do you want the AI to accomplish? Be as precise as possible. A well-defined goal ensures the AI understands its mission, whether it's summarizing a document, generating creative text, answering a specific question, or performing a complex task. Think about the **desired outcome** and articulate it clearly.

### Example

Here you provide a **concrete, imitable sample** of the desired output. For any structured response, showing is more effective than telling. This removes ambiguity and is often faster and more precise than writing a complex description in the `Return Format` section.

### Return Format

Here, you specify the **exact structure and style** you expect for the AI's output, especially if an example isn't provided or if you need to add further constraints. Do you need a bulleted list, a JSON object, or a specific tone? Clearly outlining the return format helps the AI deliver a response that integrates seamlessly into your workflow.

### Warnings

Use this space to outline any **constraints, limitations, or actions the AI should avoid**. This acts as a set of guardrails for the AI. For instance, you might instruct it not to exceed a certain word count, avoid sensitive topics, or refrain from using jargon. Warnings help to prevent undesirable outputs and ensure the AI's response adheres to specific guidelines.

### Context Dump

This is where you provide **all the necessary background information, data, or source material** the AI needs to perform its task. Think of it as the knowledge base for the AI's response. This can include raw text, code snippets, lists of facts, previous conversations, or any other relevant data. The more comprehensive and relevant your context, the better the AI can understand the nuances of your request and generate an accurate, helpful response.
