## Explanation

### Goal

This section is where you define the **primary objective** of your prompt. What do you want the AI to accomplish? Be as precise as possible. A well-defined goal ensures the AI understands its mission, whether it's summarizing a document, generating creative text, answering a specific question, or performing a complex task. Think about the **desired outcome** and articulate it clearly.

### Return Format

Here, you specify the **exact structure and style** you expect for the AI's output. This is crucial for getting a usable response. Do you need a bulleted list, a JSON object, a short paragraph, or a specific tone? Clearly outlining the return format helps the AI deliver a response that integrates seamlessly into your workflow or meets your presentation needs.

### Warnings

Use this space to outline any **constraints, limitations, or actions the AI should avoid**. This acts as a set of guardrails for the AI. For instance, you might instruct it not to exceed a certain word count, avoid sensitive topics, or refrain from using jargon. Warnings help to prevent undesirable outputs and ensure the AI's response adheres to specific guidelines.

### Context Dump

This is where you provide **all the necessary background information, data, or source material** the AI needs to perform its task. Think of it as the knowledge base for the AI's response. This can include raw text, code snippets, lists of facts, previous conversations, or any other relevant data. The more comprehensive and relevant your context, the better the AI can understand the nuances of your request and generate an accurate, helpful response.
